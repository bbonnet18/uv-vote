        <p>These terms of service ("Terms") apply to your access and use of U-Vote (the "Service"). Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h4>Accepting these Terms</h4> 

        <p>If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing support@u-vote.us.</p>
        <h4>Changes to these Terms</h4>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.</p>

        <p>Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check U-Vote for changes to these Terms.</p>
